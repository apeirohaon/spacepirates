Earth: Kept sparkly for those living luxuriously. Work is done largely done by autonomous robotics. The site of most of those people who control the activities of the other planets. Has a a few zones of complete desolation near the poles; those few humans living there are considered to not exist by the rest of the Earth.

Solari Fortuna: Man-made planet to replace the moon, which was falling apart. Once a symbol of hope for a united humanity, now nothing more than a new new vegas. A destination where everything is ephemeral. Dedicated to the .01%.]

Mars: The first off-Earth planet to be colonized, it ended up being used for a variety of different purposes. All extremes of humanity and its socioeconomic classes can be found, depending on the spot.

Corvus X: A failed and abandoned prototype for what would become Solari Fortuna. Now in orbit around the sun, between Mars and Jupiter. It has been repurposed to be something of a pirate's den. Travel to and from the miniplanet is an endeavour recommended for only highly competent law-breakers.

Asteroid belt: Primarily a mining destination, although as more and more people made an asteroid to be their permanent home, urban constructions did pop up.

Jupiter: Some amount of private vacation homes and entertainment centers in orbit. Skydiving like Felix Baumgartner?

Neptune, Uranus, Pluto: Exclusively manned by researchers and their aides.
