Earth: Kept sparkly for those living luxuriously. Work is done largely done by autonomous robotics. The site of most of those people who control the activities of the other planets.

Mars: A mixed bag. Has a number of tourist resorts but requires a lot of manpower to keep it running. Also home to a number of refugees who got kicked off Earth for being too poor, as well as a number of enterprising men and women hoping to make a stake in the new frontier (which isn't really new any longer).

Solari Fortuna: Man-made planet to replace the moon, which was falling apart. Once a symbol of hope for a united humanity, now nothing more than a new new vegas. A destination where everything is ephemeral. Dedicated to the .01%.]

Neptune, Uranus, Pluto: Exclusively manned by researchers and their aides.
