Earth: Kept sparkly for those living luxuriously. Work is done largely done by autonomous robotics. The site of most of those people who control the activities of the other planets. Has a a few zones of complete desolation near the poles; those few humans living there are considered to not exist by the rest of the Earth.

Solari Fortuna: Man-made planet to replace the moon, which was falling apart. Once a symbol of hope for a united humanity, now nothing more than a new new vegas. A destination where everything is ephemeral. Dedicated to the .01%.]

Jupiter: Some amount of private vacation homes and entertainment centers in orbit. Skydiving like Felix Baumgartner?

Neptune, Uranus, Pluto: Exclusively manned by researchers and their `aides`.
