#### Act 1

###### Scene 1

The protagonist is being pursued by a sharp enemy. He escapes with the following plan:  

1) take a relatively basic wormhole route the enemy is sure to know (but the enemy likely thinks he doesn't know they know)  
2) pretend to panic and rapidly accelerate toward a wormhole route that conventional knowledge says is excessively dangerous, but that he has some experience taking  
3) leave them in the dirt thinking he killed himself  
   [Note: emphasize that he doesn't care about "winning", only surviving; some exposition on the random wormholes popping up as tunnels see more use - scene takes place near a gate; maybe at a later point explain that his knowledge  came thanks to disregard of his life]

##### Scene 2

For a short while, he decides to wander about space to make sure that he shook the Riders off properly. [note: at some point he sees that rumors sprung up of his demise] During his drifting, he comes across a traditional-looking wizened up space seer. She informs him that will he soon encounter a three-pronged decision, and that he should choose carefully. 

###### Scene 3

Still drifting for the moment, he ponders the oracle's apparently nonsensical and excessively vague advice. He realizes that news of his "death" should have started makings its way to the more cutting-edge places by now and decides to head to the nearest rumor mill. There, perhaps due to the confounding effects that a seer's counsel can cause, he makes a mistake (of diplomatic nature, maybe) and finds himself embroiled in a scuffle. A local girl skillfully helps him get out of the situation, showcasing her negotiational skill, surprising collectedness in the face of trouble, and abundant connections. She uses the generated debt of gratitude to convince MC to let her join him on his ship, as his very first crew member.

###### Scene 4

 [ meets second person ] Girl proves self in previous scene, but the ship is in need for repairs and we meet the old mechanic in a decrepit underground space autozone. mechanic evidently doesn't like working for a shady business, but has to. We somehow convince him to be part of our crew.(Perhaps a fire fight happens in space autozone and we save his hide)

Scene 5: [ meets third person ] We meet in the bar?

--- Act 2

The crew goes on a relatively involved mission [ why? ] which they manage successfully. In the process, they warm to each other to some extent.

--- Act 3

The crew goes on another mission which goes worse. They manage to make it out with little more than their lives.

--- Act 4

As the interpersonal situation has substantially soured, and the material situation is also substandard, dissatisfaction is at a high. Various arguments ensue, designed to give deeper insights into the characters' minds. In the end they make an uneasy peace.

--- Act 5

Due to various circumstances, the crew members end up filing off the ship one by one. However, [ some stuff happens and the protagonist stops one from leaving / brings them back / saves them in a risky situations / idk or this part could happen before the people start leaving ]
