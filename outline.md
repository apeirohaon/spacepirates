--- Act 1

Scene 1: The protagonist is being pursued by a sharp enemy. He escapes with the following plan:  
1) take a relatively basic wormhole route the enemy is sure to know (but the enemy likely thinks he doesn't they know)  
2) pretend to panic and rapidly accelerate toward a wormhole route that conventional knowledge says is excessively dangerous, but that he has some experience taking  
3) leave them in the dirt thinking he killed himself  
[Note: emphasize that he doesn't care about "winning", only surviving; some exposition on the random wormholes popping up as tunnels see more use; maybe at a later point explain that his knowledge  came thanks to disregard of his life]

Scene 2: His previous job had been very high-paying (and correspondingly dangerous), so for the moment he is comfortable financially. He wanders aimlessly about the space around [ ? ] and encounters a seer after the traditional fashion. She tells him that he soon encounter a three-pronged decision, and that he should choose carefully. 

Scene 3: While pondering the seer's words in a nearby location, he encounters a girl who insists upon joining him. Despite his protestations, she manages to convince him [ how? ]

Scene 4: [ meets second person ] Girl proves self in previous seen, but the ship is in need for repairs and we meet the old mechanic in a decrepit underground space autozone. mechanic evidently doesn't like working for a shady business, but has to. We somehow convince him to be part of our crew.(Perhaps a fire fight happens in space autozone and we save his hide)

Scene 5: [ meets third person ] We meet in the bar?

--- Act 2

The crew goes on a relatively involved mission [ why? ] which they manage successfully. In the process, they warm to each other to some extent.

--- Act 3

The crew goes on another mission which goes worse. They manage to make it out with little more than their lives.

--- Act 4

As the interpersonal situation has substantially soured, and the material situation is also substandard, dissatisfaction is at a high. Various arguments ensue, designed to give deeper insights into the characters' minds. In the end they make an uneasy peace.

--- Act 5

Due to various circumstances, the crew members end up filing off the ship one by one. However, [ some stuff happens and the protagonist stops one from leaving / brings them back / saves them in a risky situations / idk or this part could happen before the people start leaving ]
