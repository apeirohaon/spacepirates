Preliminary research which showed potential for the creation of instant long-distance transportation was developed by a multi-national team of physicists at a private research institute (in the vein of Bell Labs) somewhere in eastern Europe. However, it proved difficult to carry out the theoretical work necessary to configure this potential in such a way that it seemed realizable for humans. After many decades, when enthusiasm for the topic had dwindled to nearly nothing, a lone Japanese-German man who had at an early age dedicated his life to the quest producted the landmark paper, "Considerations for the Practical Use of Tunneling Technology" - later to be widely known as simply, "the Considerations".
