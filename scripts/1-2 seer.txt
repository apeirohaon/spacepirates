Leaving the glow of the stargate behind, I merge into the planetbound traffic. 

It's not long before Orion Station is visible in the distance, and I pull off the loop. 

Orion has become something of a neighborhood to me. It's filled with my sort of crowd. They call us "floaters," people getting by on their own, without ties to a corp or anything. Originally the place was barely more than a rest stop for truckers. Now though, it's become a thriving hub for illicit dealings. 

Not that I'm interested in any business for the moment. I think I deserve a drink at the least. 

b: Hey, kid! Still haven't gotten yourself killed yet, huh? 

mc: Good to see you too, Bart. 

b: So, what'd you get up to this time around? 

mc: Nothing special [...]

I head back out to my ship to sleep for the night. There's a commotion in the lot, a robed figure struggling to break out of the grip of a much larger one. A disagreement turned violent is something I wouldn't look twice at, except for the fact that it's happening right in front of my ship. 

robed figure: Grrr... I told you I don't have anything, so just let me go!

Large man: You said you could pay! Stupid kid, I'll teach you what it means to cross someone out here!

Oh, man. This is really the worst. 

mc: Uh, this is my ship, so if you could just take your argument somewhere else we can all be on our way...

Large man: You know this brat? 

mc: What? No! Did you even hear anything I just said? 

Large man: Alright, you're both in for it!

[gets beat up]

mc: Ahhhh!! FUCK!!! My shekels!!!

girl: Uh, sorry about that. My b

girl: Let me read your fortune for you at least.

mc: No, really, I'm perfectly fine--
