Space really is a big place.

As I look out the sole window of my vessel, that's what I think.

It's filled with all kinds of people, and all kinds of opportunities.

Maybe even someone like me can stumble across that special event that'll turn my life upside down.

But from my view at the porthole, you'd think there wasn't anything out there at all.
It's so empty I can see those stars burning and churning out light from millions of kilometres away, without anything obstructing the view.  

Looking at it like this, it seems peaceful.

Egh.  
I didn't think they'd catch up so quickly. The [name1] did start out as a racing club, so I was expecting quite a high level of speed from them, but this is extraordinary. They didn't even let me finish my profound ruminations. I think I was on to something there. Inconsiderate little shits.

So how did they get here so fast?

After some consideration, I come to the conclusion that there's only one way.  
They used the [name2].

Huh. They really want my ass that bad?  
I thought I was the only one crazy enough to use those [name2].
