Space really is a big place.

As I look out the sole window of my vessel, that's what I think.

It's filled with all kinds of people, and all kinds of opportunities.

Maybe even someone like me can stumble across that special event that'll turn my life upside down.

But from my view at the porthole, you'd think there wasn't anything out there at all.
It's so empty I can see those stars burning and churning out light from millions of kilometres away, without anything obstructing the view.  

Looking at it like this, it seems peaceful.

[crashing sound effect] [screen shake]

Now... if only my little pocket of it could be so peaceful.

Egh.  
I didn't think they'd catch up so quickly. The [name1] did start out as a racing club, so they'd be fairly fast as a matter of course, but this is extraordinary. They didn't even let me finish my profound ruminations. How am I getting out of this one?

And how did they get here so fast?

After some consideration, I come to the conclusion that there's only one way.  
They used the [name2].      [<<< change this to a more reasoned deduction ; preferably showing off his knowledge/reasoning]

Huh. They really want my ass that bad?  
They didn't seem like the type to take that kind of risk.

Well, that makes the plan simple. There's nothing easier to abuse than these half-hearted newbie [name2.1]ers.

MC: This won't be fun, but it's nothing I haven't done before.

First things first. Exactly how much do they know? Despite their origins, they're a very methodical group. They have a lot of connections, so I'm not surprised one of them was savvy enough to drop them some basic [name2] knowledge. I assume they heard the same information from multiple sources. They wouldn't risk going out the wrong tail based on the word of one informant. Most likely they found a map somewhere and then got someone else to confirm it.

In any case, they're confident in their knowledge. But that means there's no way their knowledge runs deep. There's hardly anyone in the world who knows the intricacies of the [name2]s - not as well as I do, anyway. Even if they chanced upon some rumour here or there, they would never trust it enough to act on.

Frankly, it wouldn't be so hard to throw them off. There's plenty of escape routes around this area. Most aren't exactly safe, but the odds would still be in my favour.
Problem is, that would probably just focus their attention on me further. On top of everything else, [name1] is a particularly prideful group. [Whatever mc did to piss them off...] they certainly took as a personal affront. I don't fancy having to keep evading them for the rest of time.

Ideally, I want them to think that they got me. Without them actually getting me, obviously.

One thing I noticed is that they tried to conceal the fact that they used the [name2] at all. A natural thing to do - it's quite a strategic advantage.
