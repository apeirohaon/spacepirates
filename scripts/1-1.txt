Space really is a big place.

As I look out the sole window of my vessel, that's what I think.

It's filled with all kinds of people, and all kinds of opportunities.

Maybe even someone like me can stumble across that special event that'll turn my life upside down.

But from my view at the porthole, you'd think there wasn't anything out there at all.
It's so empty I can see those stars burning and churning out light from millions of kilometres away, without anything obstructing the view.  

Looking at it like this, it seems peaceful.

[crashing sound effect] [screen shake]

Now... if only my little pocket of it could be so peaceful.

Egh.  
I didn't think they'd catch up so quickly. The [name1] did start out as a racing club, so it's a matter of course they'd be fairly fast, but this is extraordinary. They didn't even let me finish my profound ruminations. How am I getting out of this one?

And how did they get here so fast?

After some consideration, I come to the conclusion that there's only one way.  
They used the [name2].

Huh. They really want my ass that bad?  
They didn't seem like the type to take that kind of risk.

Well, that makes the plan simple. There's nothing easier than abusing these half-hearted newbie [name2.1]ers.
